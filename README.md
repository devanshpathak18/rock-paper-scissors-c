✊ Rock-Paper-Scissors CLI (C Language)
A lightweight, terminal-based implementation of the classic Rock-Paper-Scissors game. Pit your skills against Tyson, a randomized AI opponent, in a high-stakes "Best of Three" tournament.

This project was developed to practice fundamental C programming concepts, including state management, input validation, and time-based random number generation.

🌟 Features
Tournament Mode: Plays a "Best of Three" series to determine the ultimate winner.

Smart AI (Tyson): Uses the time.h library to ensure truly randomized moves every round.

Input Validation: Robust handling of user inputs to prevent crashes or invalid moves.

Clean CLI Interface: Real-time score tracking and clear round-by-round results.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Language: C

Libraries: * stdio.h (Standard I/O)

stdlib.h (Standard Library)

time.h (To seed the random number generator)
